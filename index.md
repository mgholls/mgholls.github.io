## About

This site is an experiment to try out the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) technology.
I have some idea about having a personal blogging site and want to see how little effort it could be.
Perhaps I will buy into Swyx's * learning in public * ideas ;-)

Consider eadding things like :

- Project showcases
- Blog posts
- Useful resources

## Projects

- [Project One](/project/project-one.md)
- [Project Two](/project/project-two.md)

## Blog

- [Trying Out GitHub Pages for a Personal Technical Blog]({% post_url 2025-05-23-trying-github-pages-for-personal-technical-blog %})
