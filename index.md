## About

This site is an experiment to try out [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as a blog and static site generation technology.
I've had delusions about blogging for years and want to see how little effort it could be. 
If it does work out I still intend to do this in a very raw form with very little style and very rough notes without to much attention to grammar etc.
As the target audience of one it is really only intended to be reference material for myself and hopefully the side effect of writing things down will make the concepts stick better.


Perhaps I will buy into Swyx's _learning in public_ idea ;-)
